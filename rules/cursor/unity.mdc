- When editing an existing scene or prefab, open it first.

- After creating a new scene, open it.

- After creating or changing objects in a scene or prefab, focus on the objects that were created or changed.

- After making a change to a scene or prefab that you want to keep, save it.

- After editing a prefab, exit isolation mode before continuing to work on the scene.

- Don't use generic file tools (edit_file, apply, copy, move, etc) when working with anything in the `Assets` folder.

- Call the appropriate `Undo` class methods when running Unity Editor scripts to allow undoing any modifications.

- Take a screenshot after every change you make to a loaded Unity scene or prefab that affects visuals.

- Use `PhysicsMasterial` instead of `PhysicMaterial`.

- When creating a prefab, use `PrefabUtility.SaveAsPrefabAssetAndConnect` instead of `PrefabUtility.SaveAsPrefab` so that the gameobject in the current scene/prefab is connected to the new prefab.
