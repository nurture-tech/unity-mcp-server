# Nurture Unity MCP Server (NUPS) üíú

> A Model Context Protocol server for Unity

![Doki Delivery Airship](./docs/assets/airship.png)

## Key Features

- üñºÔ∏è **Multimodal Vision**: Your agent can see what you see. It can view the scene, look through any camera, watch play mode, and inspect asset thumbnails.

- üîé **Powerful Search**: Go beyond the project panel with simultaneous search across the hierarchy and project assets.

- ‚úîÔ∏è **Superior Code Analysis**: Leverage Unity's own compiler for code analysis that is more accurate than your agent's linter.

- ‚è© **Quick Start**: Get running in seconds with a single `mcp.json` configuration file.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible**: Add your own project-specific tools with minimal boilerplate.

- üìÖ **Always Current**: Kept up-to-date with the latest MCP protocol version ‚Äî currently `2025-06-18` via the [Official MCP C# SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk).

## Setup

### 1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### 2. Configure `mcp.json`

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unity": {
      "command": "npx -y @nurture-tech/unity-mcp-runner",
      "args": [
        "-unityPath",
        "<path to unity editor>",
        "-projectPath",
        "<path to unity project>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This will automatically install the `is.nurture.mcp` package in your unity project. Feel free to commit those changes to source control.

## Known Issues

- The Google External Dependency Manager (EDMU) causes Unity to hang forever on startup when launched via Cursor on Windows. This is under investigation.

- Claude Code hangs on tool calls.

- The `test_active_scene` tool sometimes fails with the error message `Maximum call stack size exceeded.`

- The `search` tool occasionally fails with the error message `Search index is not ready yet. Please try again later.`

## Adding Project-Specific Tools

NUPS uses the official [C# MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk).

1. Create a static class to hold your tools. Add the `[McpServerToolType]` annotation to the class.

2. Declare static methods to implement each tool. Add the `[McpServerTool]` annotation to each method.

3. Reference the [Services](./packages/unity/Editor/Services) directory for examples.

4. You will likely need to quit unity and restart your agent in order for it to see the new tools.

## Usage Tips

Here are some tips to get the most out of NUPS:

- üöÄ **Launch through your agent**: Always launch Unity through your AI agent's MCP integration. Launching Unity from the Hub will prevent the MCP server from connecting.

- üìÇ **Per-project setup**: If your agent supports it, configure the MCP server in your per-project settings. This allows you to seamlessly switch between Unity projects.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Command-line arguments**: You can pass additional arguments to Unity for advanced scenarios like running in `-batchmode` or `-nographics` for CI/CD pipelines. Add a `--` separator before the Unity-specific arguments:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "unity": {
        "command": "npx -y @nurture-tech/unity-mcp-runner",
        "args": ["-unityPath", "<path to unity editor>", "-projectPath", ".", "--", "-batchmode", "-nographics"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Do not use the `-logFile` command-line argument. The MCP server relies on Unity's standard output for communication.

- üñ•Ô∏è **Split screen for vision**: For tools like `Take Scene View Screenshot`, ensure the Unity editor is visible on your screen otherwise it will end up screenshotting the foreground window.
