# Nurture Unity MCP Server (NUPS) üíú

> A Model Context Protocol server for Unity

## Key Features

- üñºÔ∏è **Multimodal**: Your agent (with supported models) can see the Scene View, look through any camera in the scene, and watch play mode. It can also see thumbnails of your model assets.

- üîé **Superhuman Search**: Automates the Search panel to perform a converged search in the hierarchy and project assets. This is much more powerful than searching in the Project panel.

- ‚úîÔ∏è **Better Code Linting**: The MCP analyzes your Unity classes using Unity's compiler. This is more accurate than the compiler in your coding agent.

- ‚è© **Simple Setup**: Just configure your `mcp.json` and you are all set.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible**: Minimal boilerplate to add your own tools.

- üìÖ **Current**: Frequently updated to supprot the latest MCP protocol version ‚Äî currently `2025-06-18` via the [Official MCP C# SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk).

## Setup

### 1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### 2. Configure `mcp.json`

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unity": {
      "command": "npx -y @nurture-tech/unity-mcp-runner",
      "args": [
        "-unityPath",
        "<path to unity editor>",
        "-projectPath",
        "<path to unity project>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The working directory is different for different agents. So your mileage may vary using relative paths for `-projectPath`. Absolute paths will always work.

This will automatically install the `is.nurture.mcp` package in your unity project. Feel free to commit those changes to source control.

## Known Issues

- The Google External Dependency Manager (EDMU) causes Unity to hang forever on startup when launched via Cursor on Windows. This is under investigation.

- Claude Code hangs on tool calls.

## Adding Project-Specific Tools

NUPS uses the official [C# MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk).

Create a static class to hold your tools. Add the `[McpServerToolType]` annotation to the class.

Declare static methods to implement each tool. Use the `[McpServerTool]` annotation to each method.

Reference the [Services](./packages/unity/Editor/Services) directory for examples.

You will likely need to quit unity and restart your agent in order for it to see the new tools.

## Usage Tips

> Do not launch the Unity project manually from the Unity hub when working with this MCP. This will cause the MCP client to fail to connect.

> Install the MCP server in per-project settings if your agent supports this. That way you can switch between different codebases and it will launch the corresponding unity project.

> You can add additional arguments to the unity command line ‚Äî such as running in `-batchmode` or `-nographics` in order to run with background agents or inside of CI/CD pipelines. Use this format:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unity": {
      "command": "npx -y @nurture-tech/unity-mcp-runner",
      "args": [
        "-unityPath",
        "<path to unity editor>,
        "-projectPath",
        "."
        "--"
        "-batchmode"
        ...
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> _Do not add the -logFile parameter_. The mcp server requires that the log file is redirected to stdout in order to operate.

> Split your desktop with your chat agent on one side and the unity editor on the other side. The unity editor needs to be visible on screen or else the `screenshot` tool will fail to see the scene view.
